				<h3>The Story of STRONG Nation</h3>
				<p>
					Music is the ultimate motivator. It pushes you through your workout, through one last rep
					and then one more. Knowing how powerful the effect of music is on a workout, we wondered what would happen 
					if we synced the moves in a high-intensity workout to a beat? So we reverse-engineered the music for STRONG Nation™ to match every single move.
					Moving in sync with music made students consistently push themselves past their limits and meet their goals faster. Now, you can do it too.
				</p>
				<h3>Perfect For</h3>
				<p>
					Everybody and every body! Each Zumba® class is designed to bring people together to sweat it on.
				</p>
				<h3>How It Works</h3>
				<p>
					We take the "work" out of workout, by mixing low-intensity and high-intensity moves for an interval-style,
					calorie-burning dance fitness party. Once the Latin and World rhythms take over, you'll see why Zumba® Fitness 
					classes are often called exercise in disguise. Super effective? Check. Super fun? Check and check.
				</p>
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p>
					A total workout, combining all elements of fitness – cardio, muscle conditioning, balance and flexibility, boosted energy and a serious dose of awesome each time you leave class
